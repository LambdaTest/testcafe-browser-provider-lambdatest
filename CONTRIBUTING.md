### Set up your branch to write code

We use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow),
so all code changes happen through pull requests.
[Learn more.](https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/)

1. Please make sure there is an issue associated with the work that you're doing. If it doesn‚Äôt exist, [create an issue.]()
2. If you're working on an issue, please comment that you are doing so to prevent duplicate work by others also.
3. Fork the repo and create a new branch from the `dev` branch.
4. Please name the branch as <span style="color:grey">issue-[issue-number]-[issue-name(optional)]</span> or <span style="color:grey">feature-[feature-number]‚Äì[feature-name(optional)]</span>. For example, if you are fixing Issue #205 name your branch as <span style="color:grey">issue-205 or  issue-205-selectbox-handling-changes</span>
5. Squash your commits and refer to the issue using `Fix #<issue-no>` in the commit message, at the start.
6. Rebase `dev` with your branch and push your changes.
7. Raise a pull request against the master branch of the main repository.

## **Committing Code**

The repository contains one important (protected) branch:

- **master** contains the code that is tested, released, and currently under development.

All pull requests should be made directly against the **master** branch. Features and fixes that are ready for release will be merged into this branch after review and testing.

#### **Commit & Create Pull Requests**

1. Please make sure there is an issue associated with the work that you're doing. If it doesn‚Äôt exist, [create an issue](https://github.com/LambdaTest/testcafe-browser-provider-lambdatest/issues).
2. Squash your commits and refer to the issue using `Fix #<issue-no>` in the commit message, at the start.
3. Rebase `master` with your branch and push your changes.
4. Once you are confident in your code changes, create a pull request in your fork to the `master` branch in the LambdaTest/test-at-scale base repository.
5. Link the issue of the base repository in your Pull request description. [Guide on Linking a pull request to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)

####  **Commit messages**

- The first line should be a summary of the changes, not exceeding 50
  characters, followed by an optional body that has more details about the
  changes. Refer to [this link](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-messages)
  for more information on writing good commit messages.

- Don't add a period/dot (.) at the end of the summary line.
