# npm Plugin For TestCafe Integration With LambdaTest

[![Testcafe Health Check](https://github.com/LambdaTest/testcafe-browser-provider-lambdatest/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/LambdaTest/testcafe-browser-provider-lambdatest/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This plugin integrates [TestCafe](http://devexpress.github.io/testcafe) with the [LambdaTest Testing Cloud](https://www.lambdatest.com/).

## Install

```sh
$ npm install testcafe-browser-provider-lambdatest
```

## Usage
Before using this plugin, save the LambdaTest username and access key to environment variables `LT_USERNAME` and `LT_ACCESS_KEY`, as described in [LambdaTest Documentation](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/using-environment-variables-for-authentication-credentials).

You can determine the available browser aliases by running

```sh
$ testcafe -b lambdatest
```

If you run tests from the command line, use the browser alias when specifying browsers:
For Single Configuration

```sh
$ testcafe "lambdatest:Chrome@74.0:Windows 8" "path/to/test/file.js"
```

For Parallel/Multiple Configuration

```sh
$ testcafe "lambdatest:Chrome@74.0:Windows 8","lambdatest:Chrome@75.0:Windows 10" "path/to/test/file.js"
```

For Real Devices
```sh
$ testcafe "lambdatest:Galaxy S8@9:android:isReal" "path/to/test/file.js"
```


```
Not valid for real Devices: ---
                              v
```
When you use API, pass the alias to the `browsers()` method:

```js
testCafe
    .createRunner()
    .src('path/to/test/file.js')
    .browsers('lambdatest:Chrome@74.0:Windows 8')
    .run();
```

## Configuration

Use the following environment variables to set additional configuration options:

 - `LT_TEST_NAME` - Test name on LambdaTest.
 - `LT_BUILD` - Build name on LambdaTest.
 - `LT_CAPABILITY_PATH` - Path to a file which contains additional capability options as JSON file (eg. config.json)

    ```js
    {
        "Chrome@63.0:Windows 8.1": {
            "network": true,
            "visual": true,
            "timezone": "UTC+11:00"
        }
    }
    ```
    - `Chrome@63.0:Windows 8.1` is browser alias.
 - `LT_RESOLUTION` - allows setting the screen resolution for desktop browsers in the `${width}x${height}` format.
 - `LT_LOGFILE` - Logfile You can provide a specific path to this file. If you won't provide a path then the logs would be saved in your present working directory by the filename: tunnel.log.
 - `LT_VERBOSE` - true or false.
 - `LT_W3C` - true or false.
 - `LT_ENABLE_TRACE` - true or false.
 - `LT_PROXY_HOST` - Hostname/IP of proxy, this is a mandatory value.
 - `LT_PROXY_PORT` - Port for the proxy, by default it would consider 3128 if proxyhost is used For Basic Authentication, we use the below proxy options.
 - `LT_PROXY_USER` - Username for connecting to proxy, mandatory value for using 'proxypass'.
 - `LT_PROXY_PASS` - Password for the USERNAME option.
 - `LT_TUNNEL_NAME` - Human readable tunnel identifier (Name of the tunnel).
 - `LT_DIR` - Path of the local folder you want to test.
 - `LT_SELENIUM_VERSION` - Browser specific capability (Not for Real Devices)
 - `LT_CONSOLE` - true or false.
 - `LT_NETWORK` - true or false.
 - `LT_VIDEO` - true or false.
 - `LT_SCREENSHOT` - true or false.
 - `LT_TIMEZONE` - Configure tests to run on a custom time zone. (Not for Real Devices)
 - `LT_TUNNEL_NUMBER` - Number of tunnel to be spawned at a time.
 - `LOAD_BALANCED_MODE` - Load balancing between multiple tunnels spawned.

Example:

```sh
export LT_RESOLUTION="1920x1080"
export LT_TEST_NAME="Test TestCafe"
export LT_BUILD="Build x"
testcafe "lambdatest:Chrome","lambdatest:Chrome@74.0:Windows 8" tests/
```

```
LT_TIMEZONE
LT_SELENIUM_VERSION
LT_RESOLUTION

Above are not valid for real devices
